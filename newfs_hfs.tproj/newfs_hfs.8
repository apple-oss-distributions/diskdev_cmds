.Op Fl h | w
.Op Fl b Ar block-size

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Newfs_hfs
builds an HFS Plus file system on the specified special device.
Before running 
.Nm newfs_hfs
the disk should be partitioned using the
.Em Disk Utility
application or
.Xr pdisk 8 .
.Pp
The file system default parameters are calculated based on
the size of the disk partition. Typically the defaults are
reasonable, however
.Nm newfs_hfs
has several options to allow the defaults to be selectively overridden.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl N
Causes the file system parameters to be printed out
without really creating the file system.
.It Fl h
Creates a legacy HFS format filesystem. This option
is not recomended for file systems that will be
primarily used with Mac OS X or Darwin.
.It Fl w
Adds an HFS wrapper around the HFS Plus file system.
This wrapper is required if the file system will be used
to boot natively into Mac OS 9.
.It Fl b Ar block-size
The allocation block size of the file system.  
The default value is 4096.
.It Fl c Ar clump-size-list
This specifies the
.Em clump
and/or
.Em initial
sizes, in allocation
blocks, for the various metadata files.
.Em Clump
sizes are specified with the
.Fl c
option followed by a comma
separated list of the form arg=blocks.
.Pp
Example:  -c c=5000,e=500
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Em a=blocks
Set the attribute file clump size.
.It Em b=blocks
Set the allocation bitmap file clump size.
.It Em c=blocks
Set the catalog file clump size.
.It Em e=blocks
Set the extent overflow file clump size.
.El
.It Fl i Ar first-cnid
This specifies the initial catalog node ID for user files
and directories. The default value is 16.
.It Fl j Ar [journal-size]
Creates a journaled HFS+ volume.
The default journal size is 4MB.
.It Fl n Ar node-size-list
This specifies the b-tree
.Em node
sizes, in bytes,
for the various b-tree files.
.Em Node
sizes are specified with the
.Fl n
option followed by a comma separated list of
the form arg=bytes. The
.Em node
size must be a power of two and no larger than
32768 bytes.
.Pp
Example:  -n c=8192,e=4096
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Em a=bytes
Set the attribute b-tree node size.
.It Em c=bytes
Set the catalog b-tree node size.
.It Em e=bytes
Set the extent overflow b-tree node size.
.El
.It Fl v Ar volume-name
Volume name (file system name) in ascii or UTF-8 format.
